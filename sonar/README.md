# SonarQube Overview

SonarQube is an open platform to manage code quality.

The SonarQube platform is made of 3 components:

1. One Database to store (sonar-mysql)
2. One Web Server for users to browse quality snapshots and configure the SonarQube instance (sonar-server)
3. One or more Analyzers to analyze projects.(sonar-runner)

# Database

## Setup 
Run the database image tpires/sonar-mysql, Give it a name so it can be later linked with the sonar-server:

	`docker run -i -t -d -p 3306:3306 --name smysql tpires/sonar-mysql`

## Default user and password

Default user and password for mysql is sonar:123qwe.

# WebServer 

## Setup
tpires/sonar-server is out of date, we rebuild it as neroinc/sonar-server, you can pull directly from docker hub or build with Dockerfile.

Run web server and link it with the database. That link will be named "db".

	`docker run -i -t -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 --link smysql:db neroinc/sonar-server`

## Default user and password

Default user and password for web server is admin:admin.

You can now access to sonar-server by opening your browser to http://localhost:9000. 
(for Mac and Windows users, replace localhost with docker VM ip, you can get it by run: boot2docker ip)

## Plugins
All plugins locates at sonar-server/plugins/ are installed by default.

Official Java and C# language is free, however offical C\C++ and Objective C langualge plugin is commercial licenses base(Not Free!), we added free communitiy plugin instead for now.

# Sonar-Runner
Download sonar-runner from http://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/, extracted to $Sonar-Runner-Home.

Repalce $Sonar-Runner-Home\conf\sonar-runner.properties by sonar-runner\sonar-runner.properties

then ucommmented properties: sonar.host.url and onar.jdbc.url, properly configure localhost with your web server ip.

# Analysis
In the root of project $Project_Home, create and properly configure sonar-project.properties

cd $Project_Home

execute $Sonar-Runner-Home\bin\sonar-runner

for BackItUp Clients, a basic sonar-project.properties has already created in their repositories(develop branch), simply check out and you are read to go.
